# ✅ Figma Plugin Compilation Complete

## Files Ready for Figma Plugin

The following files are now ready to install as a Figma plugin:

1. **`manifest.json`** ✅ - Plugin configuration
2. **`code.js`** ✅ - Compiled JavaScript (converted from code.ts)
3. **`ui.html`** ✅ - Plugin user interface

## What Was Compiled

**Original TypeScript (`code.ts`):**

- Had TypeScript interfaces (`LayerResult`)
- Had type annotations (`: string`, `: boolean`, etc.)
- Had typed parameters (`node: SceneNode`, `variableName: string`)

**Compiled JavaScript (`code.js`):**

- Removed all TypeScript interfaces
- Removed all type annotations
- Kept all the functionality intact
- Ready to run in Figma's JavaScript environment

## Installation Instructions

1. **Open Figma Desktop App**
2. **Go to Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...**
3. **Select the `manifest.json` file from this project**
4. **The plugin will appear in your plugins list**

## File Structure Summary

```
Your Project/
├── manifest.json     ← Plugin config (references code.js)
├── code.js          ← Compiled plugin logic ✅ NEW
├── code.ts          ← Original TypeScript source
├── ui.html          ← Plugin interface
├── App.tsx          ← Web app demo (not needed for plugin)
├── components/      ← Web app components (not needed for plugin)
└── styles/          ← Web app styles (not needed for plugin)
```

## Notes

- The web app files (`App.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) are a **demo** of what the plugin looks like
- The actual **Figma plugin** only needs the 3 files listed above
- You can test the plugin functionality in Figma with real variable data
- The `code.js` file is now standard JavaScript that Figma can execute
